    <p class="para-text">Many clinicians are serving clients through telepractice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ASHA developed Telepractice Resources During COVID-19 to provide guidance on service delivery. As the pandemic continues, questions have arisen regarding interstate and international practice requirements. ASHA addresses these topics below.</p>
    <p class="para-text">Providers should be aware of the licensing regulations in the state where they are physically located and where the client is physically located at the time of the service delivery. This guidance is for all services within the Scope of Practice in Speech-Language Pathology, including services billed through insurance, private pay, or pro bono services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many states have emergency/temporary provisions in their statutes or regulations that allow members to practice across state lines for a defined period of time. ASHAâ€™s COVID-19: Tracking of State Laws and Regulations for Telepractice and Licensure Policy [PDF] provides a summary of provisions and policy changes for each state. About half of state governors have issued executive orders allowing for practice across state lines. In one third of those states, members may provide services to temporary residents but must also notify the licensure board. In the remaining states, members may provide services without notifying the board.</p>
